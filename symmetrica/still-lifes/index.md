The four most common still lifes are:

1. [Block](#block)
2. [Steeple](#steeple)
3. [Shell](#shell)
4. [Carrier](#carrier)

Strict still lifes exist with every possible possible population except for 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8. The block, carrier, and steeple are the only still lifes with fewer than 8 cells. The only 8-cell still lifes are pseudo still lifes made up of two blocks. 

<!-- Ordered by size -->

### Block

* Smallest still life, consisting of 4 cells
* Most common object
* Named after an [identical object](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Block) from the Game of Life

{% include viewer.html rle="2o$2o!" %}

The block can "eat" a cell placed at one of its corners. This behavior appears in many oscillators, including [beacon](/symmetrica/oscillators/#beacon), [dinner](/symmetrica/oscillators/#dinner), and [quartet](/symmetrica/oscillators/#quartet).

### Carrier

* 6-cell still life consisting of two [chips](/symmetrica/other-patterns/#chip)
* 4th most common still life
* Named after an [identical object](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Aircraft_carrier) from the Game of Life

{% include viewer.html rle="2o$o2bo$2b2o!" %}

### Steeple

* 7-cell still life consisting of a block and a chip
* 2nd most common still life

{% include viewer.html rle="2o$o$2b2o$2b2o!" %}

### Shell

* 14-cell still life
* 3rd most common still life

{% include viewer.html rle="bo2bo$b4o$o4bo$b4o$bo2bo!" %}

The shell can eat a [tugboat](/symmetrica/spaceships/#tugboat). It can also act as a one-time turner, reflecting a tugboat 180 degrees while getting destroyed in the process.

The table and its descendants are the most common predecessors of the shell.

### Feast

* 32-cell still life
* Occurs in two variants: cis feast (left) and trans feast (right)

{% include viewer.html rle="15b2o$2b2o9bo2bo$o2bob2o6b2obob2o$2obobo2bo7bobo2bo$3bobob2o7bobob2o$3bobo7b2obobo$2obobo7bo2bobo$o2bobob2o6b2obob2o$2b2obo2bo9bo2bo$5b2o11b2o!" %}

The feast is not very common, but it is more common than you would expect given its size. It is generated by two [beehive sparks](/symmetrica/other-patterns/#beehive-spark), allowing it to be easily constructed. The cis feast can also be generated by a tugboat and a blinker.

Both variants of the feast can eat a tugboat more efficiently than the shell. The cis feast can also act as a messy one-time 90 degree turner or duplicator. I have yet to investigate tugboat-trans feast collisions.
