            <h4>How many cellular automata are there?</h4>
            <p>14 Feb 2022</p>
            <p>
                First, a short word on notation.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    X → Y denotes the set of functions from X to Y.
                </li>
                <li>
                    [n, k] denotes the binomial coefficient "n choose k." I use this notation because it's easier to type 
                    and doesn't mess up the line spacing.</li>
                <li>
                    a : X means that a is an element of the set X. When combined with (1), this rule fits perfectly with 
                    the f : X → Y notation that everyone already uses.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                I will formally define a cellular automaton as a three-tuple (H, S, u).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    H is a finite subset of ℤ<sup>n</sup> called the <em>absolute neighborhood</em>. The <em>relative 
                    neighborhood</em> of a point x : ℤ<sup>n</sup> is the set {x + h | h : H}.
                </li>
                <li>
                    S is a finite nonempty set. The elements of S are called <em>states</em>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    u is a function (H → S) → S. That is, u takes a function mapping elements of H to states and returns a state.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To see how these three components define a cellular automaton, suppose we have an infinite n-dimensional grid, 
                and that each cell in the grid is labeled with a state. The cells can be thought of as elements of ℤ<sup>n</sup>, 
                and the global state of the grid can be thought of as a function g : ℤ<sup>n</sup> → S assigning each cell 
                to its state. For every cell c, we can define a function f<sub>c</sub> : H → S such that f<sub>c</sub>(d) = 
                g(c + d). This function gives the state of each cell in the relative neighborhood of c. Lastly, the state of 
                each cell c in the next generation can be calculated by u(f<sub>c</sub>).
            </p>
            <p>
                If |H| = m and |S| = k, how many cellular automata are possible? Well, the size of the set H → S is k<sup>m</sup>, 
                and the size of the set (H → S) → S is k^k<sup>m</sup>. This means there are k^k<sup>m</sup> choices of u, 
                and therefore  k^k<sup>m</sup> cellular automata. If we only consider automata similar to the Game of Life,
                that is, 2-state 2-dimensional automata using the Moore neighborhood, then the answer is 2^2<sup>9</sup> = 
                2<sup>512</sup> ≈ 1.34 * 10<sup>154</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the k^k<sup>m</sup> formula is somewhat misleading. Many of those automata could be rotations or 
                reflections of each other. And many of them are equivalent up to permutation of states. So if you want to 
                figure out the number of automata that actually behave differently, you need to account for the number of 
                symmetries of H, and the number of permutations of S.
            </p>
            <p>
                One important class of cellular automata is those that are <em>totalistic</em>. In a totalistic automaton, 
                the configuration of a cell's neighbors does not matter when determining its future state. The only thing 
                that matters is the <em>number </em>of neighbors that are in each state. We can define an equivalence relation 
                ~ on the set of functions H → S such that f ~ g if and only if |f<sup>-1</sup>(s)| = |g<sup>-1</sup>(s)| 
                for all states s. We can then define a totalistic automaton as a three-tuple (H, S, u) where u : (H → S)/~ → 
                S. This is a restriction of the original definition; basically, it forces the automaton to treat certain 
                cases the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                If |H| = m and |S| = k, the size of the set (H → S)/~ is the binomial coefficient [m + k - 1, m]. Each 
                element of (H → S)/~ is a way of assigning the elements of S to natural numbers such that the sum of 
                those numbers is m. For example, if there are 3 states (a, b, and c), and 9 cells in the neighborhood, 
                we can assign each state a number as follows: a → 1, b → 4, c → 4. This assignment is valid because 
                1 + 4 + 4 = 9.
            </p>
            <p>
                The number assigned to c is uniquely determined by the numbers assigned to a and b, because the total 
                sum must equal 9. So instead of looking at combinations of three numbers that add to 9, we can look at 
                combinations of two numbers that add to something less than or equal to 9. If we define C(k, m) as the 
                number of combinations of k numbers that add to m, we can write that fact as
            </p>
            <img src="equation.png" alt="C(k, m) = Σ(i = 0 ... m) C(k - 1, i)" height="80px">
            <p>
                It is also clearly true that C(1, m) = 1. Therefore, the values of C correspond exactly to the binomial 
                coefficients.
            </p>
            <img src="pascal.png" alt="image of pascal's triangle with equation: C(k, m) = [m + k - 1, m]" height="300px">
            <p>
                If |H| = m and |S| = k, the size of the set (H → S)/~ is C(k, m) = [m + k - 1, m]. So the number of 
                totalistic cellular automata with absolute neighborhood H and state set S is k^[m + k - 1, m]. 
                If H is the 2-dimensional Moore neighborhood and there are 2 states, the number is 2^[10, 9] = 
                2^10 = 1024.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Game of Life is not totalistic, because when determining the future state of a cell, the cell 
                itself is considered separately. In Life, a cell will be alive in the next generation if there 
                are three live cells in its neighborhood, or if there are four live cells in its neighborhood 
                <em>and</em> the cell itself is currently alive. Therefore, the Game of Life cannot be defined 
                with a function (H → S)/~ → S, but it <em>can</em> be defined with a function (H → S)/~ × S → S 
                which takes the current state of the cell into account. That is the definition of an 
                <em>outer-totalistic</em> cellular automaton.
            </p>
            <p>
                If |H| = m and |S| = k, the number of outer-totalistic automata is k^k[m + k - 1, m]. If H is the 
                2-dimensional Moore neighborhood and there are 2 states, this value is 2^2[10, 9] = 2^20. 
                Actually, to avoid redundancy, we should use the external Moore neighborhood (the Moore 
                neighborhood without (0, 0)), so the true number is 2^2[9, 8] = 2^18. These automata are 
                precisely those which can be described in B/S notation.
