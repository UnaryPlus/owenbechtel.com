                If f and g are odd functions, then the function x &rarr; f(x) + g(x) is also an odd 
                function. More concisely, the pointwise sum of f and g, denoted f + g, is odd. 
                In this post, I will prove that theorem in a "pointfree" manner, 
                using only the operations of function composition and pointwise sum. 
                I will not refer to argument variables like "x" and "y"; I will only refer 
                to function variables like "f" and "g". As far as I'm aware, the 
                term "pointfree" in this sense originated in the Haskell community.

                First, I need to define the property of additivity. An additive map is a function d 
                where d (f + g) = d f + d g for all functions f and g. (For the sake of brevity,
                I am leaving out the composition operator, so d f means d &compfn; f.)
                The negation function, which I will denote as n, is additive, 
                because n (f + g) = n f + n g. The reverse of additivity, 
                namely (f + g) d = f d + g d, is true for all functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next property to define is oddness. An odd function is a function f where 
                f = n f n. The sine function, for example, is odd, 
                because sin = n sin n.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we can prove that the sum of two odd functions is always odd. 
                We will start with two functions, f and g, and define them to be odd. By definition, 
                the following assumptions are true:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>f = n f n</li>
                <li>g = n g n</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By adding the two equations, we get:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>f + g = n f n + n g n</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Because n is additive, this is equivalent to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>f + g = n (f n + g n)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By the reverse-additive property of pointwise addition:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>f + g = n (f + g) n</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Q.E.D.</p>
