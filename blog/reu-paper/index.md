title: 'REU paper: Consequences of general relativity'

In the summer of 2024, I participated in the Math REU program at UMass Amherst, where I learned general relativity under the mentorship of Floyd Williams. You can read my project report, which discusses black holes (and white holes), gravitation time dilation, gravitational redshift, and the fate of the universe, [at this link](final-paper.pdf).
