In the summer of 2024, I participated in the Math REU program at UMass Amherst, where I learned general relativity under the mentorship of Floyd Williams. My project report, which discusses black holes (and white holes), gravitational time dilation, gravitational redshift, and the fate of the universe, is linked below.
