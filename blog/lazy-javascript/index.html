            <h4>Lazy Javascript</h4>
            <p>15 Nov 2021</p>
            <p>
                In <em>strict</em> languages such as Javascript, the arguments to a 
                function are evaluated even if they are never used.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">const always = (x, y) => x;
always(0, console.log("!!!"));
//returns 0, prints "!!!"</code></pre>
            <p>
                In <em>non-strict</em> languages such as Haskell, evaluation is 
                delayed until the value is actually used. If a parameter is 
                never used in the function body, that parameter will never be evaluated.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-haskell">let always x y = x
in always 0 (Debug.Trace.traceId "!!!")
--returns 0, prints nothing</code></pre>
            <p>
                Non-strict as the default evaluation strategy only makes sense in pure 
                functional languages. If an impure language were to use non-strict 
                evaluation by default, side effects would be very difficult to manage. 
                Nevertheless, it is possible to simulate non-strict evaluation in a strict 
                language such as Javascript, so long as the language has first-class functions. 
                There are two ways of doing this: the naive way and the lazy way.
            </p>
            <p>
            The simplest way to simulate non-strict evaluation is to represent arguments 
            as functions that, when called, return a value. I refer to this as the "naive" method. 
            It is also known as "call by name." This method is useful in some situations, 
            such as defining your own short-circuiting operations. However, it is not a good 
            idea in cases where the parameter is used more than once, 
            because the parameter must be re-evaluated every time it is referred to.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">//short-circuiting ternary operator
const choose = (cond, x, y) => cond ? x() : y();
choose(true, () => 0, () => bigCalculation);
//returns 0 without evaluating bigCalculation

//function that refers to its arguments twice
const chooseAndDouble = (cond, x, y) =>
  cond ? x() + x() : y() + y();  
chooseAndDouble(false, () => 0, () => bigCalculation);
//evaluates bigCalculation twice</code></pre>
            <p>
                In a call-by-name implementation, variables are evaluated every time they are referenced. 
                This is good if the variable is referenced zero times, 
                but bad if it is referenced more than once.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately, call-by-name is not the only non-strict evaluation strategy. 
                The alternative is lazy evaluation, also known as call-by-need. 
                Lazy parameters are never evaluated more than once. 
                This isn't too hard to implement in Javascript.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">//turn a function into a "lazy" function that remembers its return value
const lazy = f => {
  let value = undefined;
  return () => {
    if(value === undefined) value = f();
    return value;
  };
}

//function that refers to its arguments twice
const chooseAndDouble = (cond, x, y) => 
  cond ? x() + x() : y() + y();
chooseAndDouble(false, lazy(() => 0), lazy(() => bigCalculation));
//bigCalculation is only evaluated once this time</code></pre>
            <p>
                The definition of <code>chooseAndDouble</code> is exactly the same as before. 
                This time, however, the functions are wrapped in <code>lazy</code> before being 
                passed as arguments. This makes them "remember" their return value, 
                so when they are called a second time, they return the same value but 
                without doing any calculations.
            </p>
