                On most calculators, “log” with no explicit base denotes the base-10 logarithm. 
                This is a horrible convention. The most common logarithm in mathematics is 
                either base-e or base-2, depending on the field. The choice of 10 for the 
                so-called “common” log makes no sense at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                What is the solution to this nonsense? The base-e logarithm is called the 
                “natural log” for a reason. It even has a separate symbol: ln. 
                The best convention would be to ditch “ln” and have “log” with 
                no base denote the natural log instead of the base-10 log. This solution
                has two benefits. First, all logarithms would be written with “log” instead 
                of having two separate symbols. Second, the natural log would officially be the 
                default logarithm. From the perspective of calculus, the natural log is the One 
                True Logarithm; Every other logarithm is just the natural log scaled by some 
                constant. Making the natural log the default is the most natural thing to do.

                Another bad convention in mathematical notation is the use of sin<sup>2</sup>(x) 
                to mean sin(x)<sup>2</sup>. The only benefit of this notation is that it occasionally 
                lets you avoid brackets. If you follow the convention of always putting the argument 
                of a function in brackets, then both notations have one set of brackets: 
                sin<sup>2</sup>(x) and sin(x)<sup>2</sup>. But many mathematicians make an 
                exception to the “arguments go in brackets” rule for a few special functions 
                such as sine. In this case, the sin<sup>2</sup> notation requires one fewer 
                set of brackets; compare sin<sup>2</sup>x to (sin x)<sup>2</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the drawbacks of the sin<sup>2</sup> notation far outweigh its benefits.

                    It adds an unnecessary notational rule that must be taught to students.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I often have to mentally replace sin<sup>2</sup>(x) with sin(x)<sup>2</sup> when performing calculations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A superscript -1 is commonly used to denote the inverse of a function. 
                    Thus, sin<sup>-1</sup> means the inverse sine function. This introduces 
                    an outrageous inconsistency: sin<sup>2</sup>(x) is equivalent to sin(x)<sup>2</sup>, 
                    but sin<sup>-1</sup>(x) is absolutely <em>not</em> equivalent to sin(x)<sup>-1</sup>. 
                    Every student of mathematics has been confused by this at some point.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In many fields of mathematics, the notation f<sup>2</sup> means the function f 
                    <em>composed</em> with itself. By this convention, sin<sup>2</sup>(x) would be 
                    equivalent to sin(sin(x)). But it isn’t.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In short, the sin<sup>2</sup> notation is unnecessary, counterintuitive, 
                and inconsistent. Is a single pair of brackets really worth it?
            </p>
            <p>
                The solution I propose, of course, is to get rid of sin<sup>2</sup>(x) in the 
                sense that it is normally used, and use sin(x)<sup>2</sup> or (sin x)<sup>2</sup> instead.
            </p>

                The fundamental binary operation of functions is <em>composition</em>. 
                Sure, you can define a pointwise multiplication operator, but multiplication 
                is primarily a thing that <em>numbers</em> do. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, 
                I believe that f<sup>2</sup> should mean a function composed with itself, rather 
                than a function multiplied with itself. That is also the only definition that’s 
                consistent with the f<sup>-1</sup> notation for inverses. If “id” represents 
                the identity function id(x) = x, you can define numeric superscripts recursively as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    f<sup>0</sup> = id
                </li>
                <li>
                    f<sup>n</sup> = f ∘ f<sup>n-1</sup>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                This means that f<sup>1</sup> = f, f<sup>2</sup> = f ∘ f, and f<sup>3</sup> = f ∘ f ∘ f. 
                By substituting 0 for “n” in the second equation, you get id = f ∘ f<sup>-1</sup>, 
                or in other words, f<sup>-1</sup> is the inverse of f. You can keep going in reverse, 
                so f<sup>-2</sup> = f<sup>-1</sup> ∘ f<sup>-1</sup>, and so on. 
                This notation is already used in many fields of mathematics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last example of bad notation I’d like to address is the use of the radical symbol 
                for roots beyond the square root. The square root is common enough to warrant its own 
                symbol, but there is no point in using the same symbol with an integer next to it for 
                cube roots, fourth roots, and so on. It is just as easy to write x<sup>1/3</sup> as 
                it is to write ∛x. And expressions like x∛y can look very similar to x<sup>3</sup>√y.
