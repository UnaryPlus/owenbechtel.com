            <h4>Zero-augmentation</h4>
            <p>29 Sep 2021</p>
            <p>
                A few weeks ago I made a post called "Zero = Infinity?" 
                where I showed that zero and infinity have the same properties under multiplication. 
                This can be generalised with the concept of a "zero-augmented group." 
            </p>
            <p>
                Define G to be a group. For the rest of this post, 
                I will be using the variables a, b, and c to represent any elements of G. 
                Let Zr(G) be the monoid formed by extending G with a "zero element" z such that 
                zz = z and za = az = z. This is the "annihilation" property I mentioned in the previous post. 
                The other properties can be easily proven.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Closure: Due to the definition of a group, ab &isin; G, and since G is a subset of Zr(G), 
                    ab &isin; Zr(G). Due to the annihilation property, zz &isin; Zr(G), za &isin; Zr(G), 
                    and az &isin; Zr(G). Therefore, Zr(G) is closed under the group operation of G.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Commutativity: If G is abelian, then ab = ba by definition. 
                    Due to the annihilation property, za = az. 
                    Therefore, Zr(G) is commutative under the group operation of G if and only if G is abelian, 
                    as is the case with the positive real numbers under multiplication.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Associativity: The group axioms state that (ab)c = a(bc). If you replace a, b, or c with z, 
                    the result on both sides of the equation will be z, 
                    so the associative property will still hold. Therefore, Zr(G) is a semigroup.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Identity: Let i be the identity element of G, so that ai = ia = a. 
                    Due to the annihilation property, zi = iz = z. Therefore, Zr(G) is a monoid.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inverse: For z to have an inverse, there would have to be an element y such that yz = i. 
                    However, anything combined with z is always z, and z &ne; i. Therefore, Zr(G) is never a group.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If G is the group of positive real numbers under multiplication, 
                then the "zero element" of Zr(G) can be interpreted as either zero or infinity, 
                because both satisfy the annihilation property. 
                That's what I was getting at in the previous post. 
                Another interesting thing to consider is the zero-augmented trivial group. 
                If we denote the element of the trivial group as a, we get the following operation table:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>aa = a</li>
                <li>az = z</li>
                <li>za = z</li>
                <li>zz = z</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This means that the zero-augmented trivial group is isomorphic to the set of booleans 
                under the AND operation, with z as "false" and a as "true." 
                It is also isomorphic to the set of booleans under the OR operation, 
                with a as "false" and z as "true." Alternatively, you could view it as the monoid formed 
                by the set {0, 1} under multiplication.
            </p>
            <p>
                What happens if you augment a symmetry group? Take, for example, the group D3, 
                which is the symmetry group of the equilateral triangle. 
                Zr(D3) adds an additional transformation z such that composing z with any other transformation 
                gives you z. You can think of z intuitively as a transformation which destroys the triangle. 
                Once you destroy the triangle, it is impossible to return to the previous state by 
                applying other transformations; the information that made up the triangle is lost forever.
            </p>
            <p>
                There might already be a mathematical term for the concept of "zero-augmentation." 
                If so, I'm not aware of it.
