        Polynerdle is a math game similar to
        <a href="https://nerdlegame.com/">Nerdle</a>,
        but based on differential calculus instead of arithmetic.
        The goal of Polynerdle is to guess the polynomial
        differential equation in six tries or less. For example, the
        solution might be:
    </p>
</div>

<div id="example" class="instructions"></div>

<div class="instructions instructions-text">
    <p>
        which says that the derivative of 4x<sup>3</sup> is
        12x<sup>2</sup>. A new puzzle will appear each day.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the buttons at the bottom of the game to enter
        your guess. You can also use the keyboard. Every guess must
        be a correct and well-formed equation. Once you hit
        enter, the squares in the current row will change color.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A <span class="text-correct">teal</span> square means that
            the symbol is in the solution, and in the position you guessed.
        </li>
        <li>
            A <span class="text-somewhere">purple</span> square means
            that the symbol is in the solution, but not in the position
            you guessed.
        </li>
        <li>
            A black square means there are more of that symbol in your
            guess than in the solution.
        </li>
    </ul>
