  Ahoy!
</p>
<p>
  I'm a young man from upstate New York currently studying computer 
  science and mathematics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
  My hobbies include programming, mathematics, worldbuilding/conlanging, 
  and writing music. My online alias is "UnaryPlus," a reference to 
  the most useless C operator. This website is a collection of my projects: 
  games and animations I've created over the years (some as long ago as 
  8th grade), articles on mathematics and music theory, programming languages, 
  and some other things. I'm currently working on a conlang called Kalvaszti 
  &mdash; a project I hope to finish within a year or two.

  I have experience in many programming languages, including Javascript,
  Python, Typescript, C, and Java. My favorite language is Haskell, and I
  have <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/user/OwenBechtel">several packages</a>
  published on Hackage, the central Haskell package archive.
