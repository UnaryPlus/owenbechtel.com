  Ahoy!
</p>
<p>
  I'm a computer science student from upstate New York.
  I like programming, mathematics,
  conlanging, and writing music. My online
  name is "UnaryPlus," which is the mathematical term for the addition
  sign in expressions like "+10." Lately I've been working on the compiler
  for a pure functional language called Lune, as well as a conlang
  called Kelǫźno. I hope to finish both of these projects within the next
  few years.
